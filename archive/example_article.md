Trinidad signs production sharing agreement with BP for offshore gas block
(Reuters) -     Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday signed a production sharing agreement with a unit of British oil and gas producer BP for exploring and producing natural gas at a shallow water block, the energy ministry said.
The agreement follows an offshore bidding round launched by the Caribbean country last year, expected to encourage an increase in gas output to feed liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities.
"The Ministry of Energy and Energy Industries continues to aggressively market and execute concessions to promote exploration and investment in the upstream," it said in a release.
The contract with BP for block NCMA 2, located in Trinidad's North Coast Marine Area in water depths of approximately 200 meters (660 ft), is the second signed after a similar agreement with Shell in September for Modified U(c) block, the round's most contested area.

Grifols: Brookfields potential $6.8 billion offer undervalues the firm
MADRID (Reuters) -     Grifols said on Tuesday that Canadian investment fund Brookfield's potential 6.45 billion euro ($6.8 billion) offer significantly undervalued the Spanish drugmaker's prospects and long-term potential.
Earlier on Tuesday, Brookfield said it was considering a public offer for Grifols at 10.50 euros per A share and 7.62 euros per B share, implying a company valuation of 6.45 billion euros.
The proposal is non-binding, Brookfield said in a filing to the Spanish stock market regulator.
The Canadian private equity firm said in July it was interested in making a takeover bid jointly with the Grifols family with the ultimate goal of taking the company private.
Grifols said its board would meet later on Tuesday to consider the potential offer, but that, given the valuation, it would not be in a position to recommend that shareholders accept it.
Grifols shares were down 6% at 1310 GMT, one of the biggest falls on Spain's blue-chip IBEX 35 index.
The company has lost about 30% of its market value since January, when short-seller fund Gotham City Research accused Grifols of overstating earnings and understating debt, which Grifols denied.
On Tuesday, an investigating magistrate at Spain's High Court opened a probe into Gotham's actions saying it had found enough evidence to merit an investigation into the possible violation of market and consumer protection laws.

Vivendi sees Canal+, Havas 2024 revenue growth broadly stable
(Corrects paragraph 4 to say Vivendi will propose 1.5% return, not Canal+)
(Reuters) -French media group Vivendi on Monday announced guidance ahead of a market day for Canal+ and Havas, businesses it plans to spin off as part of the group's project to split up.
Vivendi expects the two units to record full-year revenue growth broadly in line with that of 2023, with organic net revenue between -1% and 0% for Havas.
For Canal+, "the potential finalisation of the pending MultiChoice control acquisition would significantly impact the financial profile of the Group in the medium-term in Africa and overall, adding a revenue growth engine while providing potential significant cost synergies," Vivendi said.
Vivendi also said it would propose a 1.5% return at its 2025 shareholders' meeting, while Havas will target a dividend payment of around 40% of its net income for 2024.

Blackstone nears deal for Jersey Mike's Subs, source says
(Reuters) -     Buyout firm Blackstone is nearing a deal for Jersey Mike's Subs that would value the U.S. sandwich chain at around $8 billion, including debt, and could be announced as early as this week, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the news earlier on Monday.

Blackstone's previous franchise deals include the 2007 acquisition of Hilton Hotels and its investment in Servpro, a franchise in the cleanup and emergency restoration industry.
Private equity firms have shown increasing interest in franchise operators. Last year, Roark Capital agreed to buy Subway, in a deal that people familiar with the matter told Reuters said valued the U.S. sandwich chain at up to $9.55 billion, including debt.

Springer Nature confirms outlook, targeting Open Access pivot
(Reuters) -     German publishing group Springer Nature posted 6% organic revenue growth in the first nine months and confirmed its full-year outlook, in its first earnings report since going public on Oct. 4.
The Berlin-based publisher of Nature and Scientific American said on Tuesday that nine-month revenue was 1.37 billion euros ($1.45 billion).
The firm said the growth was driven by the strong performance of its Open Access (OA) and Nature titles.
Springer Nature currently makes most of its revenue from journal subscriptions - although it has not specified the exact figure - but is moving towards an OA model where the funder or author of the research pays a fee to publish in a journal.
The company's annual targets for revenue of 1.82 billion to 1.85 billion euros ($1.93 billion to $1.96 billion) and adjusted operating profit of 505-520 million euros were broadly in line with an LSEG consensus.
"This year, we're pretty confident that we will reach the 50% milestone in terms of article volume being Open Access. I think in the foreseeable future we will also pass the threshold in terms of revenue," CEO Frank Vrancken Peeters said in a call with Reuters, noting how potential acquisitions should include a component of OA.
Springer Nature said it had used proceeds of 200 million euros from its IPO to repay outstanding debt, reducing net debt to 2.5 times its core profit (EBITDA).
The company said previously its financial leverage could be reduced to about 2.4 times following the listing.
